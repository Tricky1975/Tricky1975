- 👋 Hi, I’m Jeroen P. Broks a.k.a @Tricky1975
- 👀 I am most of all interested in creating games and setting up tools to make game creation easier on me. I am also a fantasy author (in Dutch), and I like board games, card games, playing acts on stage and well, more things.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++ and more things
- 💞️ I’m currently not really looking to collaborate with any project. If you are however interested in working some of mine out in a better way I did, hey, lemme know.
- 📫 I don't have a real contact spot on this moment.
